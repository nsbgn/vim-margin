vim-margin
===============================================================================

A small plugin to **center** your Vim windows if their width exceeds the 
`&textwidth`. This plugin is similar to the excellent 
[Goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim), but it is much simpler and it is 
intended to be enabled by default --- not just in situations where you want to 
remove *all* distractions.

This plugin is good enough to solve my **personal use case** --- that is, 
comfortable writing on a widescreen monitor in fullscreen vim, while being 
unobtrusive otherwise. The basics work, but it will likely exhibit strange 
behaviour in others' workflows. However, pull requests are welcome!

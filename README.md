margin.vim (work-in-progress)
===============================================================================

A small plugin to center your Vim windows if their width exceeds the 
`&textwidth`. This plugin is similar to the excellent 
[Goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim), but it is much simpler and it is 
intended for those who always want to have it enabled --- not just for 
distraction-free writing.
